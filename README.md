# Hugo nginx Docker

This ``Dockerfile`` was created to host my static [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website over at [CFultz.pro](https://cfultz.pro) to be a proof of concept that I could do it. 

I have attached my ``deploy.sh`` that I used as well to create my site, build the image and deploy it to my local ``Docker`` environment.

## Build


``Note: you will need to have Docker and Hugo already installed``

In your Hugo website directory, process the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/cfultz/hugo-nginx-docker.git
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Using the pre-built from DockerHub

``Note: you will need to have Docker and Hugo already installed``

This will pull the latest pre-compiled container from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cfultz/hugo-nginx) In your Hugo website directory, process the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/cfultz/hugo-nginx-docker.git
chmod +x deploy-hub.sh
./deploy-hub.sh
```
